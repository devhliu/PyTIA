add the features to support the calculation of TIA map from the single time point activity map
support method including:
- method 1: using radionuclide's physical decay [half life time];
- method 2: Hänscheid method
- method 3: prior half life time [types of models: single effective half life time for a human body; multiple effective half times for organs and lesions with segmentations].
